PB CHANGES

0.12.2 (2013-02-26)
- Better debug info when passing a wrong parameter (Bruno Cornec)
- Presentation updated for LCA 2013 (Bruno Cornec)
- pbml & pbsmtp params only queried when really needed (can be omitted in the conf file thus for those not using announces) (Bruno Cornec)
- Adds support for a 2ins target for all buildpkg call (example: sbx2pkg2ins) which adds the final installation of packages at the end (Bruno Cornec)
- tar is needed in the VM (Bruno Cornec)
- fix a bug for checkssh with test version where to many * where given (Bruno Cornec)
- Red Hat 6.2 (not RHEL) support: doesn't support setarch i386 for a x86_64, builds with the rpm command, sudo doesn't support the env_keep var, sed -i doesn't work, setupve fix (however needs a manual install of perl 5.6.2 to work) (Bruno Cornec)
- debug level is now passed to the vescrip improving debug capabilities in that script (Bruno Cornec)
- When used the env command should be passed in full path for sudo and then not skipped (Bruno Cornec)
- New deb generation regex to support non english messages better (Bruno Cornec)
- Repository files generated now contains in their name a tag corresponding to the delivery dir. This allows to have easily both a test and non-test version in the same yum repo e.g. (Bruno Cornec)

0.12.1 (2012-05-28)
- Adds pbstoponerr option in conf file to allow to overwrite the default which is back to not stopping on errors as it perturbates VE and VM build for themoment, as not all commands are expected to succeed systematically. (Bruno Cornec)
- Change urpmi.update call from /usr/bin (consolehelper) to /usr/sbin (urpmi) as that's what we have in VE. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix errors in mageia deps (Bruno Cornec)
- pb correctly now differentiate PBDEP and BPBDEP (in Env.pm for template generation) (Bruno Cornec)
- Reverting stop on error to false by default as VM are not usable for now with it. (Bruno Cornec)
- Adds option pbshowsudo (false by default) to check whether we display the detail of sudo commands (to match security requiremetns) or not (to have a nicer output) (Bruno Cornec)
- In pb create the RPM build dirs before entering in the parallel loop as sometimes 2 identical were created simultaneously, leading to an error leading to a die (Bruno Cornec)
- option -h can now be passed multiple times. one provides synopsis, two gives full help. (Bruno Cornec)
- Add a test script to have a full regression suite before publishing a new version. (Bruno Cornec) 
- Don't create a repomd.xml.key symlink if the pubkey is empty.  opensuse zypper will reject the file and refuse to use the repo (even if the option to ignore signatures is specified) (Eric Anderson)
- lots of improvement into .deb repositories support (Eric Anderson)
- Use new pbgpgcheck option to control whether we enable gpgcheck in the repo script. (Eric Anderson)
- Use new projcomponent value to specify which component we are building for -- most things probably aren't contrib (for deb based distros) (Eric Anderson)
- Tolerate the file: and flat: schemes -- they were tolerated in some places but not others. (Eric Anderson)
- Lots of documentation improvements (Eric Anderson)
- log when we start and finish the build, that's an important state. (Eric Anderson)
- Greatly simplify pb_get_distros function by using split and join. (Eric Anderson)

- Fix bug in running in 32bit VE with 64bit host. (Eric Anderson)
- Do *not* set the time in a virtual environment as it breaks stuff. (Eric Anderson)
- Tolerate failures on the debsign step -- the key-file can validly not exist. (Eric Anderson)
- Add a new option pbusesshagent in pb.conf to allow the user to specify whether he wants to use his existing SSH environement and agent, or if he prefers to create a new key pair for building. (Bruno Cornec)

- Set pb_stop_on_error, add option to continue through errors. (Eric Anderson)
- Only try to apply and sign patches if the apply script exists. (Eric Anderson)
- Add git support in pb_vcs_up, pb_vcs_checkin and pb_vcs_add. (Eric Anderson)
- Conf.pm largely rewritten to cache all conf files into a local $h hash in which conf files are added in reverse order. (Bruno Cornec)
- Improve web delivery by forcing more open modes for files (644) and dirs (755) in the web tree. (Bruno Cornec)
- Split CMS functions in 2 parts, one lowlevel reusable outside of pb in VCS.pm, the remaining stay in CMS.pm, part of pb. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix #99. Adds a new extdir member to the pb structure, in order to manage the timestamp tag added in version name for test versions and have a complete correspondance between the tar file content, and the names. This modification creates an incompatibility in the build part of pb (thus change to 0.12.x), so requires that the build environment be updated before it's usable (with setupve|vm or sbx2setupve|vm). Use the new extdir member to update existing projects filter (Bruno Cornec)

- Make the parameter of the -t option optional, in which case the underlying distro is used. (Bruno Cornec)
- Adds a cleanssh target to purge test versions on the remote repository. (Bruno Cornec)
- Adds option checkexclude and command checkssh with the -rebuild option: this allows to check after the build which packages have not been built correctly and to potentially relaunch the build. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix #93 by recoding newver partly and remove the fixed loading of a pb profile in KVM and put it in option. (Bruno Cornec)
- Start to add CPAN upload support to solve #101 - Needs to be tested now with an official version. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix a bug in the recursive function pb_list_bfiles where file handle should not be global (Bruno Cornec)
